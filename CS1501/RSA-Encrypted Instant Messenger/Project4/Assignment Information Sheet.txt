Assignment Information Sheet for Project 4 - RSA Encryption

The source files all compile & run without error. 

Particular difficulty was experienced when outputting the byte[] arrays as String objects for viewing as per the spec sheet. Turns out I just needed to use Arrays.toString(byte[]) to display them properly.
Another bug that cost me several hours of hunting and searching through code was a single line in SecureChatClient.java where I accidentally used ObjectOutputStream.write() to transmit an encrypted message 
instead of ObjectOutputStream.writeObject().
